# ERA5DataReader
Downloads evaporation data from the CDS and uploads it into QGIS for further analysis
This plugin allows users to download evaporation data through the API from the Climate Data Store (CDS) provided by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) to be used in hydrological studies. Evaporation data is uploaded into QGIS for further analysis. Also, a point vector layer is provided with an attribute table displaying statistical data for each pixel. Data are available from 1979 to present. To use the plugin, please note that a user ID and API key are required. Users can obtain their unique ID and key through logging in to the CDS (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home). The cdsapi python module is required to install the plugin. It is a third party module and can be installed using the OSGEO4W Shell by running the following three lines of code: py3_env, python -m ensurepip --default-pip, python -m pip install cdsapi
